Follow the below instructions to execute the code:

1. Open Google Colab - https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Sign into your gmail account, if not signed in already.
3. Upload the 'bbc_news_classification.ipynb' file to Google Colab. Once uploaded, the file opens automatically.
(Note: instead of the above 3 steps, the code can be directly opened in the google colab using the link provided on top of the code in bbc_news_classification.ipynb)
4. Either press Ctrl + F9 to run the code or choose 'Runtime' from the options available on top of the page and then click 'Run all'.
5. Once the first cell is executed, the second cell asks to choose files from the device. Click 'Choose Files' and upload the 'bbc_news_dataset.zip' file provided as it is. No need to modify this zip file as the code itself would extract the bbc folder after unzipping it.
6. Once the zip file is uploaded successfully, the remaining code gets executed completely and provides desired results.
